# JournalPDFScraper

This project was started as a way to find and download free PDFs from medical journals. The goal is to expedite the early parts of medical research where the researcher must search for free PDFs and create a list of paid ones to purchase. With this tool the researcher would simply run the script to identify the free PDFs.

## Status
* As it currently stands, the project is on hiatus due to class work and other projects.
* Currently there are a select number of journals that are supported, the tests under `Scrapers>Tests` show which scrapers work as some are still under development.
